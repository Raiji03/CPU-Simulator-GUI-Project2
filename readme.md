## CPU-Simulator GUI
A graphical user interface application with these components: CPU Simulator


## Implementation

```
Display metrics added in the algorithms class to display average waiting time, turnaround time, CPU Utilization, Throughput, and Individual process details.
Added Shortest Time Remaining First (STRF) and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithms to the Algorithms.cs
STRF button added on Cpuscheduler.cs
MLFQ button added on Cpuscheduler.cs
```

## Instructions
```
Execute the program.
On the GUI interface select the CPU scheduler tab on the dashboard.
Enter the number of processes that you want to be executed. (Has to numbers 1 or higher)
Select which CPU algorithm to run between FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority, STRF, and MLFQ.
Enter the burst and arrival time for each process. 
For Round Robin enter the time quantum at the end of the last process.
For Priority scheduling enter the priority after the burst time of the process.
